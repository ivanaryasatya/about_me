# 👋 Hello, I'm Ivan Aryasatya

🎓 I'm a 10th-grade student from SMK Telkom Malang born in 2009 with a deep passion for **technology, electronics, and computers**. I spend most of my time exploring code, tinkering with circuits, and turning crazy ideas into working prototypes.

## 📄 My Portfolio

You can see my latest portfolio at this link.
It contains all my projects and details about me:
[Main Portfolio](https://s.id/ivanarya-portfolio)

## 🛠️ My Skills

- 💻 **Programming:** Arduino, C++, HTML (a bit!), and learning Python
- 🔌 **Electronics:** Circuit design, sensors, relays, automation systems
- 🧠 **Problem Solving:** I love debugging stuff, finding weird bugs, and fixing them
- 🕹️ **Hobby Projects:** designing and developing IoT devices including coding, hardware design, and modeling

## 🐾 Project Highlight: Feedo – The Smart IoT Pet Feeder

**Feedo** is my personal project that combines **IoT**, **automation**, and a love for pets.

### 🔧 What It Does:
- Automatically feeds pets at scheduled times
- Can be controlled and monitored from a web-based dashboard
- Uses **ESP8266** as the brain and **IoT protocols** to stay connected
- Includes a manual feed button, automatic feeding, and failsafe mechanism

### 📡 Technologies Used:
- ESP8266 (Arduino IDE)
- Servo Motor for dispensing
- Real-Time Clock (RTC)
- WebServer UI
- Firebase database

### 🚀 Why I Built It:
Because pets deserve tech too! And because I wanted to learn more about **IoT systems**, scheduling, and real-world device reliability.
